summary: This is my first, initial blogpost where I write about my plans about this blog and my further actions
---

The technical side of the blog was made a long before I finally decided to write something in here. 
The problem is I was always overthinking on a niche of a blog I am going to run, which of course led to 
he lack of consistent planning and scheduling of topics.  
Even now I am not sure what occupation of mine to take as a main one, which hobby to follow, what journey to 
devote my whole self. But just by lying and waiting for destiny to choose it instead of me wasn't resally the 
solution I'd prefer. So i decided to start 
writing just a personal blog where I'll share my thoughts, ideas and stories. Hope this articles will be helpful 
not only for the people that follow me and maybe live similiar period, but also for myself to understand myself better, 
assemble myself and complete my goals. 
I can write alot about the problem of large amount of useless information in our times, how it can destroy human 
or what impact it had on me and my life, but it is better to keep that discussion for separate blogpost. 
Here I'd like to write about what am I going to do from now.
I guess the first thing in this blogpost will be determining my dreeams and goals. I'll then try to evaluate 
each of them and analyze whether they are possbile or what is their level of difficulty. What challenges can 
I face during it and what rewards do I get from them.
The most important one, try to understand if it is worth to start working on them and if no don't I loose even more if I 
abandon it, won't I regret it in the future? Answer to it has to be made with pure consiousness, clear heart and complex meditation.

One of my dreams that is undebatably should be realised is traveling and experience the "Freedom of New".
I call it so because emotions I feel when I explore new place physically makes me feel independent
(Although independence and freedom are different ideas in many cases).
Like you can do anything you want not only in that newly achieved place, 
but everywhere from now on and there can be no obstacle for you anymore. This sounds very euphoric, 
well who said euphoria is a totally bad feeling? (by the way I never managed to watch "Euphoria" TV Show, 
hope will do someday soon) It pretty much depends on the circumstances.

## Inline Highlighting

Sample of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
