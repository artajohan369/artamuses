summary: Initial blogpost, Welcome to the "Scenius" Arta
---

The technical side of the blog was made a long before I finally decided to write something in here. The problem is I was always overthinking on a niche of a blog I am going to run, which of course led to the lack of consistent planning and scheduling of topics.  
Even now I am not sure what occupation of mine to take as a main one, which hobby to follow, what journey to devote my whole self. But just by lying and waiting for destiny to choose it instead of me wasn't resally the solution I'd prefer. So i decided to start 
writing just a personal blog where I'll share my thoughts, ideas and stories. Hope this articles will be helpful not only for the people that follow me and maybe live similiar period, but also for myself to understand myself better, assemble myself and complete my goals


Sample of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
