summary: Let's revise my fuckups
---

In Carlos Castaneda's literature there is a procedure 
of revising events of life that caused pain, suffering 
and grief or speaking by it's terminology "loss of energy". I don't think it is
possible to restore lost energy in one article, but I'll at least write my 
fuckups that happened during 2023 as those were a lot that year and also the
most significant ones.

# Motorcycle

My first fuckup, my first big unrealised dream was a motorcycle. Driving
this motorcycle more precisely. I didn't want to pay for driving 
classes so I decided to buy a small cube motorcycle and practice on it by myself
illegally driving it in suburbs. It was Italian "Benelli TNT 150i Red" model, I was doing
great. My technique was getting better and everytime I was performing exam exercises
better and better. The theory part was already passed during that time and I had
a year for trying my luck in practical part. After each registration one needed to
wait for a month untill exam day was appointed one day before the exam itself.
So the day had come. I arrived to the city (I registered in different town
believeing it'd be easier to pass the exam there, I'd regret it veryy much later)
went to the office and performed all the necessary exercises. Instructor's
decision was that I am not confident in driving. I failed. Two months later, when trying
second time, I really fucked up. I got nervous and turned the bike wrong way. I'd spent not small
amount of money for exam motorcycle rent and exam itself, besides it was late Autumn
and riding season was reaching it's culmination. So this last fail seriously
harmed my desire for getting a license.

# Office Job 
During my senior year I was hired by a company that was planning, developing 
and testing microchips. It was a very happy time. Good office job with generous
benefits for employees. At the same time I've acquired a bachelor degree in
electronics engineering and got a certificate of IC Design professional. What could
be better? Life was great, until. Until I got bored and disappointed, until I imagined the life
mostly spent in front of computers just to create small unit of the 
gigantic technocratic machine, until I met people that were doing much better and
creating much more, although they were not more talented, smart or capable then me.

The topic is very old fashioned, but it is what happened to me. All my peers and colleagues
were ok with it, it didn't happen to them. I started to have
arguments with management about useless conservatism of the office, about availability
of remote job. I wasn't wrong, but I was too demanding and 
assertive, especially with the yet not fully developed trust and authority. So eventually
I left the office to find the implementation of my ambitions. It was 
a great experience that should be appreciated and I have enough background to have my backup in the industry,
still I consider it as a failure. A fuckup that I hope will lead me to better achievements.

# FPV
First time I was interested in FPV Drones was during Spiliology training.
The guy who was one of the best local FPV pilots was also participating in 
this courses. He was also Cinematic/VFX editor. We had many common interests
and topics to talk about. I quickly became interested in FPV and decided myself 
that one day I'll certainly learn the skill and become a good pilot.
Almost three months later the very reputable organization announced about FPV 
construction/piloting courses which was also going to be the foundation of the
formation of local FPV piloting community. What could be better?
Not only we were learning with professionals, but also there was 
an opportunity to use the laboratory for the construction and platform for 
flights. I applied immediately. The theoretical part was very interesting. 
When all the parts were delivered the practical stage began. Hello paranoia.
![FPV Debuggin](/static/images/fpvdebug.jpg) 
I was too concerned about soldering. I wanted to have purely soldered motors 
on ESC and for 6 training classes I was struggling to finish 
that. Also everytime it was my sensei who noticed poor solder quality. He
was stating on not continuing until I get a good quality. 
Eventually I've got demotivated to work in our lab and have any relations with 
the group. After some time I soldered whole drone myself of course. I've done
many mistakes and got confident on solving them. Currently I have accidentaly drowned
LiPo batteris of the drone while debugging it's soft and I have no charger to revive it,
I asked for it in our public chat, but no response (Although I'll be honest, community helped me
with some questions I had during assembling my drone, besides charger is something 
every pilot needs to have his own) I am waiting for my charger to arrive 
from the Amazon shop. After this I hope I'll finally fly my FPV and start 
cinematic projects I plan to do. I am not upset about community, they selflessly
 tought me a lot of things and helped me. Now we meet sometimes and discuss
different plans development and visions of our group. The only fuckup I regret
is it is lasting too much time to finish the my build and enjoy it.

# Conclusion
Most of the failures above are materialistic. Though they are significant for 
me and represent my dreams in a way, I can imagine what problems could I have 
and what problems many people face everyday. I appreciate what I have and
I am grateful for that. These failures were a good lesson for me. I believe those were the downhills
to prepare me for the coming huge uphill. Hopefully this year most of the achievements will cover
fuckups that happened last year, I promise I'll do my best to make it happen.
