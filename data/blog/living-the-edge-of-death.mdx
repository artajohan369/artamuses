summary: My experiences while guarding the border of my country as a mobilised active reservist
---

After I finished my two year mandatory service I never thought I'll ever come back.
But after recent war in my country having problems with defense and demography
the law for reserve service was changed. As for now the law demands 
each male citizen to participate in 23 day long service every 3 years. Seven of these days are 
for training, 1 day for rest and border patrol for remaining 15 days. I was drafted too.


# Fear

At the time I got the ticket, I was scared as hell. Every moment escalation could
start and the war was end not in a benefit for the side I was to be at, for the weak side. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void fancyAlert(bool arg) {
if (arg) {
std::cout << "Fancy Alert!" << std::endl;
}
}

int main() {
bool condition = true;
fancyAlert(condition);
return 0;
}
```

```bash
$ ls -l
