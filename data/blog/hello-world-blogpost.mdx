title: Hello World BlogPost
date: '2024-02-13'
tags: ['blogging', 'personal']
draft: false
summary: This is my first, initial blogpost where I write about my plans about this blog and my further actions
---

The technical side of the blog was considered long before I finally decided to write something here. The problem is,
I was always overthinking the niche of the blog I am going to run, which, of course, led to a lack of consistent 
planning and scheduling of topics. Even now, I am not sure which occupation to prioritize, which hobby to pursue, or 
what journey to devote myself to. However, simply waiting for destiny to choose for me wasn't really the solution 
I'd prefer. So, I decided to start writing a personal blog where I'll share my thoughts, ideas, and stories. 
I hope these articles will be helpful not only for the people who follow me and maybe are going through a similar 
period but also for myself to understand myself better, gather myself, and accomplish my goals. I could write extensively
about the problem of the vast amount of useless information in our times, how it can affect humans, or its impact on my 
life, but it's better to save that discussion for a separate blog post. Here, I'd like to write about what I'm going to 
do from now on. Write about my thoughts, goals, projects and whether it is worth to start their realization. 
If so how should I do that, what will it take from me. What habits do I need to obtain, what schedules do I need to follow
and what skills do I need. But first, as the ideas of this content are quite diverse and chaotic, I'd like to separate them into small blog
posts and establish a set of guidelines for these blog posts. Let's begin by setting the word 
count of each blog post to be between 300 and 500 words. Set the posting frequency to once every 3 days, with a latency
excuse of 1 day. The rest day is crucial for maintaining discipline and consistently working on a writing project. 
I assume that's all for the "Hello World". Peace!

I guess the first thing in this blog post will be determining my dreams and goals. 

I'll then try to evaluate each of them and analyze whether they are possible or what their level of difficulty is. What challenges can 
I face during them and what rewards do I get from them? The most important question is, should I start working on them?
And if not, do I lose even more if I abandon them? Won't I regret it in the future? The answer to it has to be made
with clarity of mind, a pure heart, and deep reflection.

One of my undeniably realizable dreams is traveling and experiencing the "Freedom of New." 
I call it so because the emotions I feel when I explore new places physically make me feel independent
(Although independence and freedom are different ideas in many cases). Like you can do anything you want not 
only in that newly achieved place, but everywhere from now on, and there can be no obstacle for you anymore. 
This sounds very euphoric; well, who said euphoria is a bad feeling? (By the way, I never managed to watch the 
"Euphoria" TV Show; hope I will do someday soon). It pretty much depends on the circumstances.









## Inline Highlighting

Sample of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
