summary: My experiences while guarding the border of my country as a mobilised active reservist
---

After I finished my two year mandatory service I never thought I'll ever come back.
But after recent war in my country having problems with defense and demography
the law for reserve service was changed. As for now the law demands 
each male citizen to participate in 23 day long service every 3 years. Seven of these days are 
for training, 1 day for rest and border patrol for remaining 15 days. I was drafted too.


# Fear

At the time I got the ticket, I was scared as fuck. Every moment escalation could
start and the war was not to end for a benefit of the side I represent. Anyways
if you get the ticket you hardly can avoid the call. Of course I could leave
the country immediately, but I am not ready for an immigrant lifestyle right now,
at least not financially. Besides I don't want to have problems with the law of
my country that I'd definitely get in case of my fugity. Serve for the country it is
I said and encouraged myself with the warrior ideology of all
the literature and practices I had knowledge about (by the way, at that time I had 
already finished Miyamoto Musashi's "The Book of Five Rings" that was a kind of 
custom workbook for sword trainings and a methodology about 
samurai discipline) at the same time I prepared myself for the worst, for death. I think 
it is a good idea for likely circumstances. With this perception fear went away, 
I was ready for the short adventure that could potentially be 
the last one I face.

# Reality

Two things that matters most in a military, crew and the system. There is a crisis in this army
and issues with ideology and political health currently in my country. 
Active reservists have bad reputation in terms of their discipline and performance
of their duties. I hadn't expected that my crew could be so mature and adequate. 
I was lucky. The reason was our class was assembled mostly from the central developed
districts of the city. It may sound biased, but facts talk themselves. Now about
the system. FUCK THIS SYSTEM. The management was weak, organization in all aspects
of problems was slow. I will be silent about beuracratic issues and how undigitalized 
is this institute. A fragile system full of vulnerable spots. We are one of the first
crews that is being drafted by this new law, so this issues may be understandable, but in no case
those are permittable. Trainings were not hard at all, I wish they were. 
Border Patrol had an unusual schedule, and the conversion was especially 
difficult for some, that loved long late sleeps in their civilian lifes. But after
 two shifts of night patrol it all had dissipated.

# Conclusion

Actually I support the idea of integrating the society with the army. By looking at the examples 
of Switzerland, Finland and Israel I can say this will be the great defensive project for the 
country I live in, that will protect all human rights of it's citizens and 
businesses that create significant value for the whole planet. I wish it happens and finally peace comes to my region.
What about me, well eventually it was not as full of experiences as I had imagined, if I may say so.
Maybe because the environment was good and stable, or because of the people there or it was me
that has some little potential of being "Tough Cold Motherfucker" at such a stressfull places too and it was me that had \
fully freezed his emotions and maintained so before "Living on The Edge of Death".
